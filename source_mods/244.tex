\section[Problem \#244: Sliders]{Sliders}
\label{sec:problem_244}

You probably know the game \emph{Fifteen Puzzle}. Here, instead of
numbered tiles, we have seven red tiles and eight blue tiles.

A move is denoted by the uppercase initial of the direction (Left,
Right, Up, Down) in which the tile is slid, e.g. starting from
configuration (\textbf{S}), by the sequence \textbf{LULUR} we reach the
configuration (\textbf{E}):

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}m{1cm}m{4cm}m{1cm}m{4cm}@{}}
\toprule
\endhead
(\textbf{S}) & \includegraphics{project/images/p244_start.gif} &
,~(\textbf{E}) & \includegraphics{project/images/p244_example.gif} \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

For each path, its checksum is calculated by (pseudocode):

checksum = 0\\
checksum = (checksum × 243 + \texttt{m}\textsubscript{1}) mod
100 000 007\\
checksum = (checksum × 243 + \texttt{m}\textsubscript{2}) mod
100 000 007\\
\hspace*{0.333em}\hspace*{0.333em}\hspace*{0.333em}\ldots{}\\
checksum = (checksum × 243 + \texttt{m}\textsubscript{\texttt{n}}) mod
100 000 007\\

where \texttt{m}\textsubscript{\texttt{k}} is the ASCII value of the
\texttt{k}\textsuperscript{\texttt{th}} letter in the move sequence and
the ASCII values for the moves are:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\endhead
\textbf{L} & 76 \\
\textbf{R} & 82 \\
\textbf{U} & 85 \\
\textbf{D} & 68 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

For the sequence \textbf{LULUR} given above, the checksum would be
19761398.

Now, starting from configuration (\textbf{S}), find all shortest ways to
reach configuration (\textbf{T}).

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}m{1cm}m{4cm}m{1cm}m{4cm}@{}}
\toprule
\endhead
(\textbf{S}) & \includegraphics{project/images/p244_start.gif} &
,~(\textbf{T}) & \includegraphics{project/images/p244_target.gif} \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

What is the sum of all checksums for the paths having the minimal
length?
