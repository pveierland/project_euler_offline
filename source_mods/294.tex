\section[Problem \#294: Sum of digits - experience \#23]{Sum of digits - experience \#23}
\label{sec:problem_294}

For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in
its usual decimal representation. Thus d(42) = 4+2 = 6.

For a positive integer n, define S(n) as the number of positive integers
k \textless{} 10\textsuperscript{n} with the following properties :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  k is divisible by 23 and
\item
  d(k) = 23.
\end{itemize}

You are given that S(9) = 263626 and S(42) = 6377168878570056.

Find S(11\textsuperscript{12}) and give your answer mod
10\textsuperscript{9}.
