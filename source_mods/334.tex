\section[Problem \#334: Spilling the beans]{Spilling the beans}
\label{sec:problem_334}

In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight
line.\\
Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.\\
A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two
beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent
bowls.\\
The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.

For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans
respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves
will finish the game:

You are given the following sequences:\\

\begin{align*}
\qquad t_0 &= 123456,\\
\qquad t_i &= \begin{cases}
\;\;\frac{t_{i-1}}{2}, & \text{if } t_{i-1} \text{ is even}\\
\left\lfloor\frac{t_{i-1}}{2}\right\rfloor\oplus 926252, & \text{if } t_{i-1} \text{ is odd}\end{cases}\\
&\qquad\text{where }\lfloor{}x \rfloor \text{ is the floor function}\\
&\qquad\!\text{and }\oplus{}\text{ is the bitwise XOR operator.}\\
\qquad b_i &= (t_i\bmod2^{11}) + 1.\\
\end{align*}

The first two terms of the last sequence are $b_1 = 289$ and
$b_2 = 145$.\\
If we start with $b_1$ and $b_2$ beans in
two adjacent bowls, $3419100$ moves would be required to
finish the game.

Consider now $1500$ adjacent bowls containing
$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{1500}$ beans respectively, all other bowls being empty.
Find how many moves it takes before the game ends.
