\section[Problem \#802: Iterated Composition]{Iterated Composition}
\label{sec:problem_802}

Let $\mathbb{R}^2$ be the set of pairs of real numbers
$(x, y)$. Let $\pi = 3.14159\cdots\ $.

Consider the function $f$ from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to
$\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $f(x, y) = (x^2 - x - y^2, 2xy - y + \pi)$, and its
$n$-th iterated composition $f^{(n)}(x, y) = f(f(\cdots f(x, y)\cdots))$. For
example $f^{(3)}(x, y) = f(f(f(x, y)))$. A pair $(x, y)$ is said to
have period $n$ if $n$ is the
smallest positive integer such that $f^{(n)}(x, y) = (x, y)$.

Let $P(n)$ denote the sum of
$x$-coordinates of all points having period not
exceeding $n$. Interestingly, $P(n)$ is
always an integer. For example, $P(1) = 2$,
$P(2) = 2$, $P(3) = 4$.

Find $P(10^7)$ and give your answer modulo
$1\,020\,340\,567$.
