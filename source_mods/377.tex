\section[Problem \#377: Sum of digits - experience \#13]{Sum of digits - experience \#13}
\label{sec:problem_377}

There are 16 positive integers that do not have a zero in their digits
and that have a digital sum equal to 5, namely:\\
5, 14, 23, 32, 41, 113, 122, 131, 212, 221, 311, 1112, 1121, 1211, 2111
and 11111.\\
Their sum is 17891.

Let \texttt{f}(\texttt{n}) be the sum of all positive integers that do
not have a zero in their digits and have a digital sum equal to
\texttt{n}.

Find $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{17} f(13^i)$.\\
Give the last 9 digits as your answer.
