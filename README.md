# Project Euler Offline

Project Euler Offline is an unofficial compilation of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problem set for offline use.

- It contains all Project Euler problems as of the date of compilation, including all problem data files as PDF attachments via the [attachfile2 LaTeX plugin](https://ctan.org/pkg/attachfile2).
- Animations are produced with the [animate LaTeX plugin](https://ctan.org/pkg/animate). Note that animations require a PDF reader with JavaScript support. Support has been confirmed in [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/) on Linux (remember to select *View* â†’ *Show Forms*).
- Bonus feature: Appendix about Roman numerals.

## Download
